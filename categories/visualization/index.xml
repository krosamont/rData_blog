      <description>After having watched Justice League in cinema, I was impressed by all of the special effects and how good they were. I started wondering myself: How much does a movie like that cost? And most importantly, how big is the box-office revenue for this kind of blockbuster? I found an answer in The Numbers. I have then decided to make a database from the data available on this website. I have retrieved the 500th biggest movie budgets.</description>

      <description>Model interpretation is essential in the social sciences. If one wants to know the effect of variable x on the dependent variable y, marginal effects are an easy way to get the answer. STATA includes a margins command that has been ported to R by Thomas J. Leeper of the London School of Economics and Political Science. You can find the source code of the package on github. In this short blog post, I demo some of the functionality of margins.</description>

      <title>Let&#39;s make ggplot2 purrr again</title>

      <description>Update: I’ve included another way of saving a separate plot by group in this article, as pointed out by @monitus. Actually, this is the preferred solution; using dplyr::do() is deprecated, according to Hadley Wickham himself.
I’ll be honest: the title is a bit misleading. I will not use purrr that much in this blog post. Actually, I will use one single purrr function, at the very end. I use dplyr much more.</description>
