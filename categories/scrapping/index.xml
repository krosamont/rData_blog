      <description>One of my journalist friend was looking at the result of the local election in Luxembourg and he was dissatisfied because he was unable to compare the results of all the communes. In fact, he wanted to compare the number of women that were candidates in each commune. So I asked him to hold on and I came back one hour later with this script that enables him to collect results of all communes in one table.</description>

      <description>A lot of open data is available in Luxembourgâ€™s open data portal, but sometimes, it is not very easy to download. In the video below, I give you an example of such data and show how you can use rvest to get the data easily.
After watching the video, take a look at the code below. This code does two things; first it scrapes the data, and then it puts the data in a tidy format fur further processing.</description>
