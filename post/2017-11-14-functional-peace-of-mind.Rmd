I think what I enjoy the most about functional programming is the peace of mind that comes with it.
With functional programming, there's a lot of stuff you don't need to think about. You can write
functions that are general enough so that they solve a variety of problems. For example, imagine
for a second that R does not have the `sum()` function anymore. If you want to compute the sum of,
say, the first 100 integers, you could write a loop that would do that for you:

```{r}
numbers = 0

for (i in 1:100){
  numbers = numbers + i
}

print(numbers)
```

The problem with this approach, is that you cannot reuse any of the code there, even if you put it
inside a function. For instance, what if you want to merge 4 datasets together? You would need
something like this:

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
data(mtcars)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
data(mtcars)
```

```{r}
mtcars1 = mtcars %>%
  mutate(id = "1")

mtcars2 = mtcars %>%
  mutate(id = "2")

mtcars3 = mtcars %>%
  mutate(id = "3")

mtcars4 = mtcars %>%
  mutate(id = "4")

datasets = list(mtcars1, mtcars2, mtcars3, mtcars4)

temp = datasets[[1]]

for(i in 1:3){
  temp = full_join(temp, datasets[[i+1]])
}

glimpse(temp)
```

Of course, the logic is very similar as before, but you need to think carefully about the structure
holding your elements (which can be numbers, datasets, characters, etc...) as well as be careful
about indexing correctly... and depending on the type of objects you are working on, you might need
to tweak the code further.

How would a functional programming approach make this easier? Of course, you could use
`purrr::reduce()` to solve these problems. However, since I assumed that `sum()` does not exist,
I will also assume that `purrr::reduce()` does not exist either and write my own, clumsy
implementation. Here's the code:

```{r}
my_reduce = function(a_list, a_func, init = NULL, ...){

  if(is.null(init)){
    init = `[[`(a_list, 1)
    a_list = tail(a_list, -1)
  }

  car = `[[`(a_list, 1)
  cdr = tail(a_list, -1)
  init = a_func(init, car, ...)

  if(length(cdr) != 0){
    my_reduce(cdr, a_func, init, ...)
  }
  else {
    init
  }
}
```

This can look much more complicated than before, but the idea is quite simple; *if you know about
recursive functions* (recursive functions are functions that call themselves). I won't explain how
the function works, because it is not the main point of the article (but if
you're curious, I encourage you to play around with it). The point is that now, I can do the following:

```{r}
my_reduce(list(1,2,3,4,5), `+`)

my_reduce(datasets, full_join) %>% glimpse
```

And if I need to merge another dataset, I don't need to change anything at all. Plus, because `my_reduce()` 
is very general, I can even use it for situation I didn't write it for in the first place:

```{r}
my_reduce(list("a", "b", "c", "d", "e"), paste)
```

Of course, `paste()` is vectorized, so you could just as well do `paste(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)`, but again, I want
to insist on the fact that writing or using such functions allows you to abstract over a lot of thing.
There is nothing specific to any type of object in `my_reduce()`, whereas the loops have to be tailored
for the kind of object you're working with. As long as the `a_func` argument is a binary operator
that combines the elements inside `a_list`, it's going to work. And I don't need to think about
indexing, about having temporary variables or thinking about the structure that will hold my
results.
