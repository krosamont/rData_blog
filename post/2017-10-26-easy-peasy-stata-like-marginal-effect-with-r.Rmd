Model interpretation is essential in the social sciences. If one wants to know the effect of
variable `x` on the dependent variable `y`, marginal effects are an easy way to get the answer.
STATA includes a `margins` command that has been ported to R
by [Thomas J. Leeper](http://thomasleeper.com/)
of the London School of Economics and Political Science. 
You can find the source code of the package 
[on github](https://github.com/leeper/margins). In this short blog post, I demo some of the 
functionality of `margins`.

First, let's load some packages:

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tibble)
library(broom)
library(margins)
library(Ecdat)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tibble)
library(broom)
library(margins)
library(Ecdat)
```

As an example, we are going to use the `Participation` data from the `Ecdat` package:

```{r}
data(Participation)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?Participation
```


```
Labor Force Participation

```

The variable of interest is `lfp`: whether the individual participates in the labour force or not.
To know which variables are relevant in the decision to participate in the labour force, 
one could estimate a logit model, using `glm()`.

```{r}
logit_participation = glm(lfp ~ ., data = Participation, family = "binomial")
```

Now that we ran the regression, we can take a look at the results. I like to use `broom::tidy()` 
to look at the results of regressions, as `tidy()` returns a nice
`data.frame`, but you could use `summary()` if you're only interested in reading the output:

```{r}
tidy(logit_participation)
```

From the results above, one can only interpret the sign of the coefficients. To know how much a
variable influences the labour force participation, one has to use `margins()`:

```{r}
effects_logit_participation = margins(logit_participation) 

print(effects_logit_participation)
```

Using `summary()` on the object returned by `margins()` provides more details:

```{r}
summary(effects_logit_participation)
```

And it is also possible to plot the effects with base graphics:

```{r}
plot(effects_logit_participation)
```

This uses the basic R plotting capabilities, which is useful because it is a simple call to the
function `plot()` but if you've been using `ggplot2` and want this graph to have the same look as
the others made with `ggplot2` you first need to save the summary in a variable.
Let's overwrite this `effects_logit_participation` variable with its summary:

```{r}
effects_logit_participation = summary(effects_logit_participation)
```

And now it is possible to use `ggplot2` to create the same plot:

```{r}
ggplot(data = effects_logit_participation) +
  geom_point(aes(factor, AME)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(x = factor, ymin = lower, ymax = upper)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
```

So an infinitesimal increase, in say, non-labour income (`lnnlinc`) of 0.001 is associated with a
decrease of the probability of labour force participation by 0.001*17 percentage points.

You can also extract the marginal effects of a single variable, with `dydx()`:

```{r}
head(dydx(Participation, logit_participation, "lnnlinc"))
```

Which makes it possible to extract the effects for a list of individuals that you can create yourself:

```{r}
my_subjects = tribble(
    ~lfp,  ~lnnlinc, ~age, ~educ, ~nyc, ~noc, ~foreign,
    "yes",   10.780,  7.0,     4,    1,    1,    "yes",
     "no",     1.30,  9.0,     1,    4,    1,    "yes"
)

dydx(my_subjects, logit_participation, "lnnlinc")
```

I used the `tribble()` function from the `tibble` package to create this test data set, row by 
row. Then, using `dydx()`, I get the marginal effect of variable `lnnlinc` for these two individuals.
No doubt that this package will be a huge help convincing more social scientists to try out R and
make a potential transition from STATA easier.
