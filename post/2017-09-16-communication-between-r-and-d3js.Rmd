Hello everyone,

In this post we will focus on how to send a message from R to javascript. More precisely, we will focus on the basic keywords and knowledge to
integrate a d3.js graph into shiny, just like [here](blog.rdata.lu/visualization/fret/).
If you have any issue to make shiny and javascript communicate after reading this post, I suggest
you to go back to this simple [shiny app](http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/server-to-client-custom-messages.html)
from Rstudio.<br><br>

First of all, create a folder where you will put your data file (`.csv`, `.txt`, etc..) and your
`app.R` (or `ui.R` and `server.R`). In this folder,  you will create a new folder that you will name "www". Put your `.css` and `.js` file inside the `www` folder. <br><br>
<img src="/img/folder_www.png" style = "max-width:100%;"> <br><br>

To make R and d3.js communicate, you will have to put some keywords in the server part, the ui part and the `.js` file.<br><br>
In the `server.R` file, write which data you want to send to javascript in an `observe({ })` function. Just like below:

```
function(input, output, session) {
    observe({
        dataSendToJs = "Hello World"
        session$sendCustomMessage(type = 'nameOfTheMessage',dataSendToJs)
    })
}
```

`session$sendCustomMessage( )` allows you to send your data from shiny to javascript. <br><br>

In the **ui.R** file, source the javascript document with a tag function.

```
fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Example"),
  fluidRow(
  #Shiny way to integrate html code in the web page
  tags$head(tags$script(src = "message.js"))
  )
)
```

<br>

Your `.js` file has to begin with `Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler("nameOfTheMessage", function(message) {` like in the following example.
Don't forget that the message represents data from R that javascript will read so it's better to transform the data to json data. You can do it in R via the function `jsonlite::toJSON()`.

```
Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler("nameOfTheMessage",
                                      function(message) {
                                              alert(JSON.stringify(message));
                                      });
```

Now it should work! You can find the whole process in this repository. We started with something simple but you can do more complex things by applyng the same logic.

Be careful, if you're working locally, you have to make some changes:
First, you need to have a webserver. I use [web server for chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en).
If you choose to use the same web server, it's very simple. <br>

First, in "CHOOSE FOLDER", you have to choose the `www` folder that you made previously, then a web server url will appear.
Click on it, then a new web page with the different files from `www` should pop-up.<br><br>
<img src="/image/webserver_source.png" style = "max-width:100%;"> <br><br>
In `ui.R` (or the ui part of your single-file shiny app), source `d3.min.js` and all `.css` and `.js` files as follow:

```
#http://127.0.0.1:8887 represents the web server URL
tags$head(tags$script(src = "http://127.0.0.1:8887/d3.min.js"))
```
The following video may help you if you have issues to make your application run locally:
<iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GHRZaiYh2Ac" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style = "max-width:100%; height:55vh;"></iframe>

Now it should work :)
